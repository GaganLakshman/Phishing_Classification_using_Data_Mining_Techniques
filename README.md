# Phishing_Classification_using_data_mining_Techniques
This project was created as a part of Data mining course at National College of Ireland

The project involved implementing and evaluating classification algorithms for classifying phishing websites using data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features were subjected to Feature selection algorithm such as Chisquare with Information Gain, Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance(mRMR) and Boruta, 
this was done in order to improve the performance of the Classification Algorithm. Selected features were used with Logistic Regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost.

3 Classification algorithms produced same accuracy, but with different number of features. Logistic Regressor took the least load and produced a accuracy of 94 %.
